# Git & GitHub Mastery: Complete Learning Path

A comprehensive, structured curriculum covering Git version control and GitHub collaboration from beginner to advanced level. This course is organized into progressive modules with hands-on exercises and real-world projects.

## Course Overview

This self-paced learning resource contains detailed lessons, practical examples, and exercises across three main skill levels. Each topic is covered in dedicated files with clear explanations and actionable examples.

## Course Structure

### Beginner Level

**Introduction**
Get started with version control fundamentals. Learn what version control is, understand the difference between Git and GitHub, explore why Git is essential for modern development, and set up your development environment properly.

**Basic Concepts**
Master the foundational concepts including repository basics, the three states of Git (working directory, staging area, and repository), and how data flows between these states.

**First Steps**
Learn essential commands to initialize repositories, clone existing projects, check status, stage changes, and make your first commits. Includes best practices for writing commit messages.

**Basic Operations**
Explore viewing project history with git log, comparing changes with git diff, using .gitignore files effectively, and understanding basic Git workflows.

**Exercises**
Practice creating your first repository, making basic commits, and working through beginner-level projects to solidify foundational skills.

### Intermediate Level

**Branching**
Understand what branches are and why they're crucial. Learn to create, switch, and manage branches. Covers branch naming conventions and basic branch strategies.

**Merging**
Master different types of merges including fast-forward and three-way merges. Learn to identify, understand, and resolve merge conflicts using various tools and techniques.

**Remote Repositories**
Work with remote repositories on GitHub. Learn the differences between fetch and pull, master push operations, and understand tracking branches for distributed collaboration.

**Undoing Changes**
Safely reverse changes using checkout, reset, revert, and restore commands. Understand the critical differences between these commands and when to use each one.

**GitHub Basics**
Set up your GitHub account, configure SSH keys and personal access tokens, create repositories, write effective README files, and optimize your GitHub profile.

**Collaboration**
Learn forking workflows, create and review pull requests, work with GitHub issues and issue templates, and manage collaborators effectively.

**Exercises**
Practice branching and merging scenarios, resolve various types of conflicts, make your first pull request, and engage in collaborative development exercises.

### Advanced Level

**Rebasing**
Master git rebase for cleaner history. Learn interactive rebasing for commit management, understand when to use rebase versus merge, follow the golden rule of rebasing, and handle rebase conflicts.

**Advanced Operations**
Use cherry-pick to apply specific commits, manage work-in-progress with stash, create and manage tags (both annotated and lightweight), track changes with blame, and debug with bisect.

**Git Workflows**
Explore and implement popular workflows including GitFlow, GitHub Flow, trunk-based development, forking workflow, and feature branch workflow. Learn how to choose the right workflow for your team.

**Git Internals**
Understand how Git works under the hood: Git objects, blobs, trees, commits, references, HEAD and branches, directory structure, packfiles, and garbage collection.

**Advanced GitHub**
Deep dive into GitHub Actions for CI/CD including workflows, jobs, steps, triggers, and marketplace actions. Learn GitHub Pages, Projects, Wikis, Discussions, security features (Dependabot, security advisories, code scanning, secret scanning), and GitHub Packages.

**Advanced Collaboration**
Master code review techniques, create pull request templates, implement branch protection rules, require reviews, use CODEOWNERS files, and manage teams effectively.

**Hooks and Automation**
Implement Git hooks for automation including client-side and server-side hooks. Use pre-commit, commit-msg, and pre-push hooks. Explore hook frameworks for easier management.

**Submodules and Subtrees**
Work with Git submodules and subtrees for managing dependencies and related projects. Understand the differences between them and learn monorepo strategies.

**Advanced Techniques**
Use reflog to recover lost commits, rewrite history with filter-branch and filter-repo, work with multiple working trees, implement sparse checkout, use shallow clones, and manage large files with Git LFS.

**Performance Optimization**
Maintain repository health through proper maintenance tasks, optimize large repositories, use garbage collection, prune unnecessary objects, and leverage commit graphs.

**Exercises**
Practice rebasing scenarios, implement complete workflows, build CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions, handle complex conflict situations, and complete a comprehensive capstone project.

## Additional Resources

**Best Practices**
Guidelines covering commit best practices, branch naming conventions, code review standards, security practices, repository structure, documentation, and team conventions.

**Troubleshooting**
Solutions for common errors, merge conflict scenarios, detached HEAD states, authentication issues, push/pull problems, and recovery techniques.

**Real-World Scenarios**
Practical guides for open source contribution, team collaboration, hotfix workflows, release management, monorepo management, and migration strategies.

**Tools and Resources**
Overview of Git GUI tools, command-line enhancements, IDE integrations, useful aliases, Git configurations, and recommended learning resources.

**Cheatsheets**
Quick reference guides organized by skill level (beginner, intermediate, advanced) plus GitHub-specific commands and general quick reference.

**Projects**
Hands-on projects including personal portfolio creation, collaboration exercises, CI/CD pipeline implementation, open source contributions, and team workflow simulations.
