What Is Version Control?
Version control is a method of tracking and managing changes made to files over time. It allows developers to save multiple versions of a project, switch between them, compare changes, and collaborate efficiently without losing work.

When software projects grow, so do the number of files, contributors, and changes. Managing all of this manually becomes impossible. Version control solves this by keeping a complete history of every modification.

Why Version Control Matters
1. Complete Change History
Every update—who made it, when it was made, and what exactly changed—is recorded. This helps in understanding the evolution of a project.

2. Error Recovery
If something breaks or a feature introduces a bug, you can simply revert to a stable version without losing all progress.

3. Easier Collaboration
Multiple people can work on the same project simultaneously without overwriting each other’s work. Version control merges everyone’s contributions safely.

4. Parallel Development
Developers can create independent branches to work on features, bug fixes, experiments, or documentation. These branches keep the main project clean and stable.

Types of Version Control
1. Local Version Control
Changes are tracked only on a single system. This system is simple but has limitations, especially for collaboration.

2. Centralized Version Control
A server stores all project versions, and developers access it through clients. One failure in the central system could affect everyone. Examples: SVN, CVS.

3. Distributed Version Control
Every developer has a full local copy of the entire project history. Work can be done offline, and collaboration becomes faster and safer.
Example: Git.

Real-World Example

Imagine writing a report and saving multiple copies like:
 - report-final.docx
 - report-final-final.docx
 - report-v1.docx
 - report-v2.docx

Version control eliminates this confusion. It tracks every version automatically and organizes it in a clean, structured way—without duplicated files.
