# Three States of Git

Git manages files by moving them through **three well-defined states**. Understanding these states is critical to using Git correctly and confidently.

---

## Overview of the Three States

Every file in a Git project exists in one of the following states:

1. **Working Directory**
2. **Staging Area (Index)**
3. **Git Repository**

These states represent the lifecycle of changes from editing to permanent storage.

## 1. Working Directory

The working directory is the place where you actively work on files.

* Files are edited, created, or deleted here
* Changes are not yet recorded by Git
* Git only sees these changes after specific commands are run

Examples:

* Writing code
* Updating configuration files
* Adding new project files

At this stage, changes exist only on your local system.

---

## 2. Staging Area (Index)

The staging area is an intermediate step between the working directory and the repository.

* Holds changes that are ready to be committed
* Allows selective commits
* Helps organize meaningful commit history

When you add files to staging, you are telling Git:

> “These exact changes should go into the next commit.”

---

## 3. Git Repository

The Git repository is where committed changes are permanently stored.

* Each commit is saved as a snapshot
* Commits form a chronological project history
* Stored inside the `.git` directory

Once changes reach this state, they become part of the version history.

## State Transition Flow

```
Working Directory → Staging Area → Git Repository
```

### Commands Involved

* `git add` → moves changes to the staging area
* `git commit` → saves staged changes to the repository

---

## Why Git Uses Three States

* Provides control over what gets committed
* Prevents accidental commits
* Enables clean and logical commit history
* Supports professional workflows

This design makes Git powerful and flexible compared to simpler version control systems.

---

## Real-World Example

1. Modify multiple files in the working directory
2. Stage only relevant files using `git add`
3. Commit staged changes with a clear message

Unrelated changes can be staged and committed separately.

## Summary

* Git tracks files using three states
* Working Directory is for editing
* Staging Area prepares commits
* Git Repository stores permanent history

Mastering these states is essential for effective Git usage.
