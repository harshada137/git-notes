# Repository Basics

A **Git repository** is the core structure where Git stores and manages all versions of a project. Understanding repository basics is essential before performing any Git operations.

---

## What is a Repository?

A repository (repo) is a directory that contains:

* Project files (source code, configuration files, assets)
* A hidden `.git` folder that stores version history and metadata

The `.git` directory contains:

* Commit history
* Branch information
* Configuration settings
* Staging data

Without this folder, Git cannot track changes.

---

## Types of Git Repositories

### 1. Local Repository

* Exists on your local machine
* Used for development and testing
* Created using `git init` or `git clone`

### 2. Remote Repository

* Hosted on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket
* Used for collaboration and backup
* Accessed via network

---

## Creating a Repository

### Initialize a New Repository

```bash
git init
```

This command:

* Creates a `.git` folder
* Starts version tracking

### Clone an Existing Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```

This copies:

* All files
* Entire commit history

---

## Repository Structure

* `.git/` → Git internal data
* Working files → Project source files

Only `.git` controls versioning.

---

## Why Repository Matters

* Maintains complete history
* Enables collaboration
* Allows rollback and recovery
* Supports branching and merging

---

# Three States of Git

Git manages files through **three distinct states**, which define how changes move through the system.

---

## 1. Working Directory

* Where files are edited
* Contains modified or new files
* Changes are not yet tracked by Git

---

## 2. Staging Area (Index)

* Temporary holding area
* Stores selected changes for the next commit
* Allows partial commits

---

## 3. Git Repository

* Stores committed snapshots
* Represents permanent project history
* Changes here are versioned

---

## State Flow

```
Working Directory → Staging Area → Git Repository
```

Commands involved:

* `git add` → move to staging
* `git commit` → save to repository

---

# Working Directory

The **working directory** is the actual folder on your system containing project files.

---

## Characteristics

* Files can be:

  * Tracked
  * Untracked
* Reflects the current checkout
* Changes here are local only

---

## File Status in Working Directory

* **Untracked** → new files not added
* **Modified** → changed tracked files
* **Unmodified** → unchanged files

Check status:

```bash
git status
```

---

## Role in Development

* Write code
* Modify configurations
* Prepare files for staging

Nothing is versioned until staged.

---

# Staging Area

The **staging area** acts as an intermediate step between working directory and repository.

---

## Purpose of Staging Area

* Select specific changes
* Organize commits logically
* Avoid committing unnecessary changes

---

## Common Commands

### Stage a File

```bash
git add filename
```

### Stage All Changes

```bash
git add .
```

### Unstage a File

```bash
git restore --staged filename
```

---

## Why Staging is Important

* Cleaner commit history
* Better code reviews
* Professional workflows

---

# Git Repository

The **Git repository** is where Git permanently stores committed changes.

---

## What Happens in a Commit

* Git takes a snapshot of staged files
* Assigns a unique commit hash
* Records author and timestamp

---

## Commit Command

```bash
git commit -m "commit message"
```

---

## Repository Data

Contains:

* Commits
* Branches
* Tags
* Logs

---

## Viewing History

```bash
git log
```

---

## Importance of Git Repository

* Single source of truth
* Enables collaboration
* Supports CI/CD pipelines
* Ensures code integrity

---

## Summary

* Repository manages version control
* Git operates in three states
* Working directory is for editing
* Staging area prepares commits
* Git repository stores history

Mastering these concepts is essential for **real-world Git usage**.
